Basic ToDo list webapplication using the following stack 

Frontend: React

Backend: Python + Quart

Database: MongoDB

Containerization: Docker

To Run: 
need to have docker desktop downloaded and open 
run : docker compose up --build 
to clean up before changes run: docker compose down 

can also run front end locally if you cd into the front end folder and do npm install / npm start 

git commands because i forget alot 

git add . 
git commit -m ""
git push 

to know if we are behind in the tree: git status 
check .gitignore file to make sure we arnt commiting node modules (what a hassle)
