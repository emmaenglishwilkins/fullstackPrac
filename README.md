# fullstackPrac

Basic ToDo list webapplication using the following stack 

Frontend: React

Backend: Python + Quart

Database: MongoDB

Containerization: Docker

To Run: 
need to have docker desktop downloaded and open 
run : docker compose up --build 
to clean up before changes run: docker compose down 

can also run front end locally if you cd into the front end folder and do npm install / npm start 

git commands because i forget alot 

git add . 
git commit -m ""
git push 

to know if we are behind in the tree: git status 
check .gitignore file to make sure we arnt commiting node modules (what a hassle)


Goal: 

Right now this is a todo list but i want to turn it into a wish list website /database 

can input the amount of money i want to spend and then it will give all possible iterations of what to buy 

depending might need to keep up with what is available still and the date it was added to wishlist 

-- could also have an iteration like the 3 ring binder scrapbook style thing that i wanted to make (digitally or irl)



okeee baiii
